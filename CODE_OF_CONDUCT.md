# Code of Conduct

**Last Updated:** February 18, 2026. This Code of Conduct canonically lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/spynnn-org/spynnn), see there for updates.

Like many open source projects, our project is built on a Code of Conduct. Please read this document carefully before contributing to this project, as it provides behavioral guidelines that all contributors are expected to follow.

## Notes

This Code of Conduct applies to anyone who participates in this project, including but not limited to: code contributors, issue reporters, pull request reviewers, and anyone engaging in project-related discussions. **Not having read this Code of Conduct is not a valid excuse for violating it.**

While we've provided detailed examples below, it's impossible to cover every situation in one document. In general, treat others how you wish to be treated—if you wouldn't like to be treated in a particular way, don't treat others like that either.

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity & expression, nationality, physical or mental disabilities or differences (regardless of intensity), politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or sub-cultural affiliation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and we are committed to promoting these concepts.

## Our Standards

We expect contributors to participate in a positive, authentic, and deliberate way. Consideration, respect, and empathy are key when it comes to building and supporting a healthy community, and we ask that our contributors demonstrate this through their actions.

Please keep in mind that open source projects bring people together from many different cultures and backgrounds. It's important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings.

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy, patience, and kindness toward other contributors
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Respecting others' personal choices, even when they don't align with yours
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Recognizing and respecting that maintainers and contributors volunteer their time and expertise without compensation**
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the project and its community

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others
- Public or private harassment
- Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission ("doxxing")
- Gatekeeping others' access to mental health or accessibility tools
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behavior
- **Demanding immediate responses, features, or fixes from maintainers, or showing entitlement to their unpaid labor**
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a contributor engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from the project, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights with regards to the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to: code repository, issue trackers, pull requests, project documentation, mailing lists, chat channels, and any other forums created by the project team.

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting a Problem

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **\[To avoid spam from crawlers, please find the maintainers' emails in Git\]**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
