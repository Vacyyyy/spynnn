## Preamble

Thank you for your interest in contributing. As the maintainer, I do not take help for granted, whether it be discussions, pull requests, input, feedback, bug reporting, issues, or whatever else.

 I hope you can also respect the work I put into this project, _including_ the specific, strict, and perhaps even pedantic workflows I enforce. I am aware that the workflow I enforce through CI and policies makes it harder for outsiders to contribute code. **One of the primary philosohpies of this project is correctness; ease of access for new code contributors is simply secondary to this**. If you are a software developer, want to contribute, but don't want to follow this project's workflows, first of all I encourage you to give it a chance and see its potential, please consider opening an issue for your contribution regardless--just respect the project's issue workflow in that case.
**If you you give the workflow a try, you should see that I put a lot of work into making the DX as seemless as possible and guiding you through it.**

## Legal matters

With that out of the way, onto some legal stuff. This project is licensed under GPLv3. By contributing, you agree to GitHub's Terms of Service, specifically the "Inbound=Outbound" rule:

> "Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms."

This means once you contribute, you generally do not have the right to revoke the license you give me, the maintainer, to your contribution, even though we do not use a Contributor License Agreement. For technical legal reason, this project enforces every file (except `LICENSE`) to contain this copyright header at the very top (optionally in a comment or comments as per the file's needs):

```
Copyright © 2026 Vacyyyy and contributors (see git history)
SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
```

Due to this project being licensed under AGPL (instead of just GPL), we are also required, as per Section 13 of the license, to share code even if users only access it over the network. This is why this repository itself contains `NOTICE`.
