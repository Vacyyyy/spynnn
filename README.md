# Spynnn

### **(NOTE: Spynnn is in VERY active development and is _in no way usable_)**

**Spynnn** is a domain-specific language (DSL) MIDI instrument designed for **Algorithmic DJing** (similar to algorithmic music). It provides a high-level, text-based interface for manipulating audio playback, mixing, and effects in real-time using Mixxx as an audio engine.

Unlike generative music environments (like TidalCycles), Spynnn focuses on **State Transitions** (e.g. fades, cuts, loops) applied to pre-recorded audio tracks. Spynnn doesn't exist to map every button of the Mixxx UI to a DSL, we instead aim to have feature parity with Mixxx's controls on the abstract levels of what you can do to music; Spynnn isn't a remote control for Mixxx, it is its own instrument, its own paradigm of DJing.
